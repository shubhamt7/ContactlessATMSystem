# Contactless ATM System (CATMS)
## A touchless ATM System based on Computer Vision (Object Detection)

## How does it work? ⚒

* CATMS uses a virtual keyboard, which can be operated using a pointer of yellow color (any other color can also be specified).
By pointer, we mean any small object, for example a pen-cap. ⌨
* The coordinates of that pointer on the keyboard are computed using an opencv library, and corresponding keys are pressed (according to the position of the ,pointer on keyboard). 🌐
* For increased security, an image of user is clicked and stored in the system when he attempts to log in. 📸


## Why is it better than touch-based ATMs? 🙄🤔
 
* It is more hygienic than the touch-based ATMs because we don't need to touch the screen 😎✔
* It is the ATM of the future and it's cooler 😎🎉✌

## Here's how it feels like to use the CATMS..
